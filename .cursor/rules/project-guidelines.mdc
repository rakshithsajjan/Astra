# Project Development Rules

1. **DeepWiki First**  
   Whenever you need clarification about the original Min repository—or any public GitHub codebase—consult DeepWiki MCP before doing anything else.

2. **Record Learnings Promptly**  
   After a failure is diagnosed and fixed, add the takeaway to [learnings.md](mdc:md/learnings.md) so that future work benefits from past insights.

3. **Follow the Master Plan**  
   Treat [main.md](mdc:md/main.md) as the authoritative roadmap. Review it at the start of every new feature and implement changes in a controlled, step-by-step manner.

4. **Track Progress Transparently**  
   Keep an up-to-date TODO list and progress log in [progress.md](mdc:md/progress.md) using straightforward Markdown checklists.

5. **Document Repository Understandings**  
   When you develop a high-level understanding of the repository structure or key logic flows, write a concise summary to [understood.md](mdc:md/understood.md) so future work can start from that shared knowledge base.
